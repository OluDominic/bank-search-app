## 📊 Result Counter

Dynamic counter shows filtering results:

- **All results:** "Branches (45)"
- **Filtered:** "Branches (12 of 45)"
- Updates in real-time as you search/filter

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Used
```json
{
  "react-native-share": "^12.2.0"
}
```

**Note:** Uses `react-native-share` for a simpler, more reliable export solution that works immediately without requiring native rebuilds.

### State Management
```typescript
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
const [selectedState, setSelectedState] = useState('');
const [stateMenuVisible, setStateMenuVisible] = useState(false);
const [exportMenuVisible, setExportMenuVisible] = useState(false);
```

### Filtering Logic
```typescript
const filteredBranches = useMemo(() => {
  return bankBranches.filter((branch) => {
    const matchesSearch = searchQuery === '' ||
      branch.branchName.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
      branch.address.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase());
    
    const matchesState = selectedState === '' || 
      branch.state === selectedState;
    
    return matchesSearch && matchesState;
  });
}, [bankBranches, searchQuery, selectedState]);
```

### Export Functions
- `exportToCSV()` - Generates and shares CSV file
- `exportToPDF()` - Generates and shares text file
- Uses native share sheet on mobile
- Fallback to file save notification
